# NoiTech
A Mindustry mod based around refinery, recycling and filtering.

This mod adds / changes (this information might be outdated):

	· New ores: Halite and Sulfur

	· New materias and alloys: Dense alloy, Sludge and Stone

	· New liquids: Heavy oil, Light oil, Fuel, Natrium, Lava, Tinted water and Mineral water

	· New environment: Black stone, Dirt, Red soil and Tainted ice

	· New factories:
	 > Condesner - Slowly condensates water from the atmosphere
	 > Tainter - Taints water by using spore pods
	 > Oil refinery - Processes raw oil into heavy oil
	 > Heavy oil processor - Processes heavy oil into fuel
	 > Chemical plant - Processes heavy oil into light oil
	 > Light oil orocessor - Processes light oil into fuel
	 > Smelter and Arc smelter - Smelts copper and lead into dense alloy
	 > Centrifuge - Separates and cools lava in order to obtain various minerals contained in molten stone
	 > Coal liquidifier - Crushes and processes coal into oil
	 > Filter - Filters tainted water by using coal
	 > Lava solidifer - Cools lava to stone at a fast pece
	 > Stone melter - Heats up stone to very high temperatures to obtain lava
	 > Sifter - Sifts sand to receive scrap
	 > Sludge recycler - Recycles sludge into small bits of oil
	 > Natrium extractor - Extracts natrium from halite
	 > Mineral extractor - Extracts salt from mineral water
	 > Rock crusher - Crushes stone into sand

	· New liquid blocks: 
	> Liquid distributor

	· New power blocks: 
	> Liquid combustion generators - Genrators that work on coal and liquids (oil, fuel).
	> Meddium battery - stores more power that battery but less than large battery.
	> Meddium solar panel - produces more power that solar panel but less than large solar panel.

	· New turrets:
	> Burner - Burns any ground enemies close to it.
	> Tsunami - Shoots streams of liquid at enemmies.
	> Radius - A small close-range anti-air electric turret. Fires arcs of electriciry at enemies.
	
	· Changes almost every single mid-game vanilla craft and almost all vanilla blocks requirments
