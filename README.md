A Mindustry mod based around refinery, recycling and filtering.
-
This mod adds / changes (this information might be outdated):

	· New ores: Bauxite, Iron, Aluminum, Hlite and Sulfur

	· New materias and alloys: Dense alloy, Insulattor Alloy Sludge and Stone

	· New liquids: Heavy oil, Light oil, Fuel, Natrium, Lava, Polluted water, Tinted water and Sulfur water

	· New enviropment: Black stone, Dirt, Polluted dirt, Red stone, Red soil and Tainted ice

	· New factories:
	 > Condesner - Slowly condensates water from the atmosphere
	 > Tainter - Taints water by using spore pods
	 > Oil refinery - Processes raw oil into heavy oil
	 > Heavy oil processor - Processes heavy oil into fuel
	 > Chemical plant - Processes heavy oil into light oil
	 > Light oil orocessor - Processes light oil into fuel
	 > Polluted water recycler - Recycles polluted water.
	 > Smelter and Arc smelter - Smelts iron and lead into dense alloy
	 > Bauxite smelter - Smelts raw bauxite into iron using coal as fuel
	 > Bauxite melter - Melts bauxite into liquid
	 > Bauxite refinery - Separates molten bauxite into aluminum, titanium, iron and silicon
	 > Centrifuge - Separates and cools lava in order to obtain various minerals contained in molten stone
	 > Coal liquidifier - Crushes and processes coal into oil
	 > Filter - Filters tainted water by using coal
	 > Sulfur filter - Filters sulfur water by removing sulfur
	 > Insulator weaver - Parses and combines aluminum, silicon and light oil to sew insulator alloy
	 > Lava solidifer - Cools lava to stone at a fast pece
	 > Stone melter - Heats up stone to very high temperatures to obtain lava
	 > Sifter - Sifts sand to receive scrap
	 > Sludge recycler - Recycles sludge into small bits of oil
	 > Natrium extractor - Extracts natrium from halite
	 > Salt extractor - Extracts salt from water
	 > Sulfur extractor - Extracts sulfur from sulfur water
	 > Rock crusher - Crushes stone into sand

	· Power and liquid related blocks and turrets: Liquid distributor, Liquid combustion generators, Meddium battery and solar panel, "Burner", "Tsunami" and "Radius"
	
	· Changes almost every single mid-game vanilla craft and almost all vanilla blocks requirments
